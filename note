getlogin() cannot be used to determine the current user name becuase
it would always fail if the current process does not have a controlling
terminal;
use getpwuid(getuid()) instead.

SUSv3 requires that PIPE_BUF be at least _POSIX_PIPE_BUF (512). An
implementation should define PIPE_BUF (in <limits.h>) and/or allow the call
fpathconf(fd, _PC_PIPE_BUF) to return the actual upper limit for atomic writes.
